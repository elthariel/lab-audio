= Presentation =

Promethee is a project of live/impro oriented [LV2] sampler. 

*Promethee (as all our projects) is looking for graphists who could make us professional graphical interfaces.*

For the moment it's GUI is ugly and not handy at all but it will be highly improved as the project evolves.

As you might see it has a limited number of features at this time, but like the GUI it will grow with the time.

= Goals =

For the moment, the roadmap can be found here [http://lab-audio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/sampler/TODO TODO file].

I'm open to any suggestions and ideas, please use the "Issue" tab, on top of this page,
use "Features-request" as label when you write your message.
