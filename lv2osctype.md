# Introduction #
this extension allow to pass osc message to the engine

two solutions:
  * a port is an osc message ("ii", "isi", "fsi")
  * a port is a osc server (regroup as many messages as it need)

the first seem better.

Do we need timestamped messages?

# Goals #
  * have trigger ports (to trigger event or sample)
