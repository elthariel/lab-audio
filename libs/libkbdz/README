  - Midi controllers
  - Virtual controllers

Via these format :
  - linux evdev's
  - Alsa seq

It supports ODL (OSC Discovery and learn protocol) to build learn
manager.


It is developped to speed up the development of a graphical event
manager (for 'desktop'sound stations) and of a daemon and command line
tools equivalents (for embedded applications).

It will be implemented as a multithreaded library.  When all the basic
work is done, SMP safety will be added
